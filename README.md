- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stellarium
- 👀 I’m interested in Astronomy, but I also like computers in general. I like to see the creations that are posted in GitHub.
- 🌱 I’m starting to become familiar with Computer Science.
- 💞️ I’m here mostly to rate the sources instead of downloading them and leaving, I am here so I exist here.
- 📫 How to reach me by twitter @frs2006 or Saturnus with the 1979 in its Bio.
