- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stellarium
- 👀 I’m interested in Astronomy, but I also like computers and coding although I don't know how to code, lol. I like to see the creations that are posted in GitHub
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding and computer science slowly(some Python 3).
- 💞️ I’m here mostly to rate the sources instead of downloading them and leaving, this account was made for have a voice here.
- 📫 How to reach me by twitter @frs2006 or Saturnus with the 1979 in its Bio.
